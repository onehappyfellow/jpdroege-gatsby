Welcome to the Workshop

"I'm a professional software developer 


"Currently consulting as a senior developer with RSI (www.ruralsourcing.com), I do both front end and full stack development for fortune 1000 clients. My preferred technologies are Node, React, Python for scripting and AWS infrastructure. I'm slowly working my way though an MS in computer science at ASU with a focus on big data. I get excited about prototyping, building new features and A/B testing."
